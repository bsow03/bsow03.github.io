This is a project that I was assigned in my Information Technologies class (IST 195) at Syracuse University. 
This project is a simple web page that I created using HTML and CSS to give visitors a basic summary of who I am, where I am from, and what I am studying.
In addition, it features a nice photo of YOURS TRULY to go along with the summary about myself.
